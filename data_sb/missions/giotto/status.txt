First, as to CDPP status, many Giotto RPA data are already available in 
the PDS! These are data from the HALLEY mission (1986) present in 
the directory /cdrom/cd7/giotto/jpa_merg/ in the file called jpamerge2, 
merged with JPA and MAG data. Maybe since there is no explicit /rpa
directory (no independent file), they do not appear clearly! I know very
well the origin of these RPA data.  THey came from a merged magnetic tape
where I personaly introduced them! This merged tape was exchanged between
the institutes involved in the MAG, JPA, RPA and IMS experiments.
So, I guess you refer to Grigg-Skjellerup data (1992). The situation is 
different. There was no systematic production of data files (outside
level_0) for this mission. An archiving effort will begin soon at CNES 
with my collaboration.
