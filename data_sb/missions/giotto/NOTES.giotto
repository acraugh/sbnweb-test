In order to compose the descriptions of what the instruments are measuring
in the "On-Board Instruments Table", I have been looking at the scanned
articles in IWH Vol 25 (/cdicarus7/document/esa_1077), a document file in the 
GEM disk (/cdicarus9/document/docinfo.txt), and the webpage 
http://www.if.ufrgs.br/ast/solar/eng/giotto.htm
