In order to compose the descriptions of what the instruments are measuring
in the "On-Board Instruments Table", I have been looking at the webpage for
the DS1 instruments.
The page for MICAS is
http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/micas.html
and the page for PEPE is
http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/tech/spectrometer.html
To write the mission description of the DS1 mission I have been looking
at the DS1 web site. The site location is 
http://nmp.jpl.nasa.gov/ds1/
NSSDC also has a DS1 page. The URL is
