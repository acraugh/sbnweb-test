  Instrument Overview                                                         
  ===================                                                         
    The High Resolution Imager (HRI) consists of a long-focal-length          
    telescope with a dichroic beam splitter, located in front of the focal    
    plane, that reflects visible (0.3 to 1.0 microns) light through a         
    filter wheel to a CCD for direct, optical imaging.  The beam splitter     
    transmits the near-infrared light (1 to 5 microns) to a 2-prism           
    spectrometer.  For convenience, we consider these as two separate         
    instruments, HRIV (High Resolution Visible CCD) and HRII (High            
    Resolution IR spectrometer), sharing the telescope since the two          
    focal planes operate in parallel asynchronously.                          
                                                                              
    The HRI telescope is a classical Cassegrain design with the following     
    parameters:                                                               
                                                                              
      Primary aperture        : 30.0 cm diameter, round                       
      Primary focal ratio     :  4.5                                          
      Secondary Obscuration   :  9.7 cm diameter, round                       
      Secondary magnification :  7.8x (net Cassegrain focal length 1050 cm)   
      Back focal distance     : 30.0 cm                                       
                                                                              
    The dichroic beam-splitter has equal transmission and reflection          
    occurring at about 1.05 microns and is placed in front of the             
    telescope focal plane.  The spectrometer is a 2-prism design, one         
    of calcium fluoride (CaF_2) and one of zinc selenide (ZnSe) to            
    maximize etendue and minimize problems with order separation.  The        
    camera and collimator lead to a net demagnification of 3x, for an         
    effective focal ratio of f/12 and effective focal length of 360 cm in     
    the final beam.  The entrance slit subtends on the sky 2.53               
    milliradians by 10 microradians (0.145 degrees by 2 arcseconds),          
    filling the 512-pixel height of the IR array.  The slit width matches     
    the binned pixel (2x2) mode used for most observations.                   
                                                                              
    The near-infrared detector is a 1024 (wavelength) x 512 (spatial)         
    pixel mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) device manufactured by           
    Rockwell using the multiplexer originally developed under contract        
    from the University of Hawaii for use in the WFC3 on HST.  Physically,    
    it is a 1024 x 1024 device, but only half of the device is active.        
    Pixels are 18 microns square and normal operations include 2x2            
    binning (post-readout).  Spectral resolving power, because of the         
    2-prism design, varies from greater than 740 at 1.04 microns down to      
    210 at 2.6 microns, and back up to 385 at 4.8 microns.  Due to            
    saturation problems in warm areas of a cometary nucleus, the central      
    quarter of the detector is covered with a neutral density filter.         
                                                                              
    When operated in the 512 x 256 pixel, 2x2 binning mode, the HRII          
    instrument has the following field-of-view characteristics:               
                                                                              
      Spatial

        Physical Pixel Size :   36 micrometers                                
        Effective Pixel FOV : 10.0 microradians or 2.06265 arcseconds         
        Effective FOV       :  2.5 milliradians or 0.15 degrees

      --------                                                                
        Effective Pixel FOV : 10.0 microradians                               
        Effective FOV       : 10.0 microradians (slit width)                  
                                                                              
      Note:  For unbinned modes, the effective spatial FOV is                 
             5.0 microradians per pixel.                                      
                                                                              
    The spectrometer includes an internal stimulator lamp for calibrating     
    between the two quadrants of the spectrometer (i.e., not as a standard    
    calibrator).  However the lamp was broken during one of the ground        
    thermal-vacuum tests and was not replaced.  Therefore this lamp was       
    never used during the Deep Impact and EPOXI missions.                     
                                                                              
    The three instruments on the flyby spacecraft, HRII, HRIV (High-          
    Resolution Visible CCD) and MRI (Medium-Resolution Visible CCD), are      
    mounted on a separate instrument platform together with the star          
    trackers.  The three instruments are nominally co-aligned as              
    described by by Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].                 
                                                                              
    For a detailed discussion of the instrument and how it was used during    
    the Deep Impact mission, see Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005]     
    and Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENETAL2005].  For the EPOXI mission,     
    the HRII instrument is used for imaging 1) Earth as a remotely-sensed     
    planet, and 2) the encounter with comet 103P/Hartley 2.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Instrument Calibration                                                      
  ======================                                                      
    The HRII instrument was originally calibrated by using in-flight data     
    acquired during Deep Impact as well as pre-launch data taken during       
    thermal-vacuum tests (TV1, TV2, and TV4) performed in 2002 and 2003.      
    In-flight calibrations continue through the EPOXI mission to monitor      
    performance and to provide additional data for refining the data          
    calibration pipeline.  Instrument calibration as well as the pipeline     
    that is shared by Deep Impact and EPOXI is discussed by Klaasen, et al.   
    (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Flight Performance                                                          
  ==================                                                          
    The HRII instrument generally performed as expected during flight.        
    During Deep Impact, small changes in instrumental temperatures            
    affected the dark current more than expected from ground                  
    thermal-vacuum tests. This effect continues for EPOXI and is discussed    
    in the Deep Impact instrument calibration paper by Klaasen, et al.        
    (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006]. Also for the prime mission in 2005, about       
    1.15% of the IR pixels were bad. Calibration data acquired three years    
    later in 2008 for EPOXI show the fraction of bad pixels has increased to  
    about 1.48%.  Therefore new bad pixel maps were generated and             
    incorporated into the calibration pipeline for EPOXI processing.          
                                                                              
    During the Deep Impact mission, early images of stars acquired by the     
    HRIV CCD indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  An analysis       
    showed the focus was forward of the HRIV CCD, so bakeouts were            
    performed in late February and early March 2005 to improve the focus.     
    The bakeouts reduced the defocus from 1.0 cm to 0.6 cm, which caused      
    the width of star images to decrease from about 12 pixels to about 9      
    pixels in a HRIV frame. This focus problem had only a nominal effect      
    on the HRII instrument.  For a detailed discussion about the focus        
    of the HRI telescope, please see Klaasen, et al. (2008)                   
    [KLAASENETAL2006] and Lindler, et al. (2007)[LINDLERETAL2007].
