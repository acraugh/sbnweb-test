      TrES-2 is a star with a detected substellar companion with the same     
      designation, TrES-2, and is a target of the Extrasolar Planet           
      Observation and CHaracterization (EPOCh) phase of the NASA EPOXI        
      mission.  Other designations for this star are GSC 03549-02811 and      
      2MASS J19071403+4918590.  The star has the following astrometric and    
      photometric properties:

      The substellar companion TrES-2 was discovered in 2006 by the           
      Trans-atlantic Exoplanet Survey (TrES).  The known properties of        
      this extrasolar planet are:
