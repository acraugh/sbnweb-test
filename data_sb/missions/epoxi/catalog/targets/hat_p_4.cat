      HAT-P-4 is a star with a detected substellar companion, HAT-P-4 b,      
      and is a target of the Extrasolar Planet Observation and                
      CHaracterization (EPOCh) phase of the NASA EPOXI mission.  Other        
      designations for this star are SAO 64638, BD+36 2593, and GSC           
      02569-01599.  The star has the following astrometric and photometric    
      properties:

      The substellar companion HAT-P-4 b was discovered in 2007 by the        
      Hungarian-made Automated Telescope Network (HATNet).  The known         
      properties of this extrasolar planet are:
