      XO-2 is a star with a detected substellar companion, XO-2 b, and        
      is a target of the Extrasolar Planet Observation and CHaracterization   
      (EPOCh) phase of the NASA EPOXI mission.  Other designations for this   
      star are GSC 03413-00005 and 2MASS J07480647+5013328.  The star         
      has the following astrometric and photometric properties:
