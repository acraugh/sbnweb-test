      WASP-3 is a star with a detected substellar companion, WASP-3 b, and    
      is a target of the Extrasolar Planet Observation and CHaracterization   
      (EPOCh) phase of the NASA EPOXI mission.  Other designations for this   
      star are GSC 02636-00195 and 2MASS J18343163+3539415.  The star         
      has the following astrometric and photometric properties:

      The substellar companion WASP-3 b was discovered in 2007 by the         
      Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP).  The known properties of this     
      extrasolar planet are:
