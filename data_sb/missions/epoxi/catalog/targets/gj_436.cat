      GJ 436 (Gliese 436) is a star with a detected substellar companion,     
      GJ 436 b, and is a target of the Extrasolar Planet Observation and      
      CHaracterization (EPOCh) phase of the NASA EPOXI mission.  Other        
      designations for this star are USNO-B1.0 1167-00204205 and 2MASS        
      J11421096+2642251.  The star has the following astrometric and          
      photometric properties:

      The substellar companion GJ 436 b was discovered in 2004 by Paul        
      Butler of the Carnegie Institute of Washington and Geoffrey Marcy of    
      the University of California, Berkeley.  The known properties of this   
      extrasolar planet are:
