  Instrument Overview                                                         
  ===================                                                         
    The Medium Resolution Imager consists of an f/17.5 Cassegrain telescope   
    followed by a filter wheel feeding directly onto a CCD for direct,        
    optical imaging.                                                          
                                                                              
    The MRI telescope is a classical Cassegrain design with the following     
    parameters:                                                               
                                                                              
      Primary aperture        : 12.0 cm diameter, round                       
      Primary focal ratio     :  3.75                                         
      Secondary Obscuration   :  6.6 cm diameter, round                       
      Secondary magnification :  4.75x (net Cassegrain focal length 210 cm)   
      Back focal distance     : 30.0 cm                                       
                                                                              
    The filter wheel contains two clear apertures and eight filters.  The     
    filters include duplicates of some of the medium-band filters in the      
    High Resolution Instrument and narrow-band filters that isolate OH,       
    CN, and C2 as well as the green and violet continuum.  These              
    narrow-band filters were designed to match the Hale-Bopp filter sets      
    used for ground-based programs since 1996.  The longest wavelength        
    filter is actually a long-pass filter that used the CCD response to       
    define the long-wavelength cutoff at about 960 nanometers.  Filter        
    transmission profiles are illustrated by Hampton, et al. (2005)           
    [HAMPTONETAL2005] and provided in the calibrated science data sets        
    for the Deep Impact and EPOXI missions.                                   
                                                                              
    The detector is a 1024 x 1024 split-frame, frame-transfer CCD with        
    21-micron-square pixels.  The electronics allow readout of centered       
    sub-frames in multiples of 2:  64x64, 128x128, and so on, with or         
    without rows of overscan.  Transfer time, to move the two halves of       
    the image from the exposing area to the two shielded areas, is about      
    5.2 milliseconds.  There are readout amplifiers in each of the four       
    quadrants.  Readout time for a full frame is 1.8 seconds.  Net pixel      
    scale is 10 microradians/pixel (2 arcseconds/pixel).                      
                                                                              
    The MRI instrument in full-frame 1024 x 1024 mode has the following       
    field-of-view characteristics:                                            
                                                                              
      Pixel Size     :   21 micrometers                                       
      Pixel FOV      : 10.0 microradians or 2.06265 arcseconds                
      Instrument FOV : 10.0 milliradians or 0.587 degrees                     
      Surface Scale  :    7 meters/pixel at 700 kilometers                    
                                                                              
    The MRI instrument includes an internal stimulator lamp for calibrating   
    between the four quadrants of the CCD; it is not a standard calibrator.   
                                                                              
    The three instruments on the flyby spacecraft, MRI, HRII (High            
    Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer) and HRIV (High Resolution Visible     
    CCD), are mounted on a separate instrument platform together with         
    the star trackers.  The three instruments are nominally co-aligned        
    as described by Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].                 
                                                                              
    For a detailed discussion of the instrument and how it was used during    
    the Deep Impact mission, see Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005]     
    and Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENETAL2005].  For the EPOXI mission,     
    the MRI instrument is used primarily during the encounter with comet      
    103P/Hartley 2.                                                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Instrument Calibration                                                      
  ======================                                                      
    The MRI instrument was originally calibrated by using in-flight data      
    acquired during Deep Impact as well as pre-launch data taken during a     
    thermal-vacuum test (TV4) performed in 2003.  In-flight calibrations      
    continue through the EPOXI mission to monitor performance and to          
    provide additional data for refining the data calibration pipeline.       
    Instrument calibration as well as the pipeline that is shared by Deep     
    Impact and EPOXI is discussed by Klaasen, et al. (2008)                   
    [KLAASENETAL2006].                                                        
                                                                              
    Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data           
    determined the two halves of the MRI CCD - the boundary being the two     
    horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while physically      
    consistent across the boundary, are biased during integration so that     
    the centers of the two halves are apparently 1/6 pixel closer to the      
    center, and the two boundary rows show a decrease in sensitivity of       
    1/6.  Reconstructed image files space all lines evenly, so the true       
    image is erroneously vertically pushed apart by 1/3 pixel at its          
    center in these reconstructions.  When making science measurements        
    from MRI images, one must therefore be very careful to properly           
    account for the two flaws introduced by the apparently narrow central     
    lines on the CCD - a geometric error that separates the image by an       
    extra 1/3 pixel at the horizontal quadrant boundary, and 2) insertion     
    of extra total radiance into calibrated images due to the flat-field      
    correction, which corrects for an apparent radiance deficit in the two    
    central rows because of the smaller number of photons actually            
    incident on those rows.                                                   
                                                                              
  Flight Performance                                                          
  ==================                                                          
    The MRI instrument generally performed as expected during flight.         
    However calibration data acquired in 2008 for EPOXI show changes to the   
    electronic crosstalk between the CCD quadrants since 2005.  Therefore     
    new crosstalk coefficients were calculated and incorporated into the      
    calibration pipeline for EPOXI processing.                                
                                                                              
  This instrument description was originally provided by Dr. Michael          
  A'Hearn for the Deep Impact mission and will be updated as the EPOXI        
  mission progresses.
