  Instrument Overview                                                         
  ===================                                                         
    The High Resolution Imager (HRI) consists of a long-focal-length          
    telescope with a dichroic beam splitter located in front of the focal     
    plane that reflected visible light (0.3 to 1.0 microns) through a         
    filter wheel to a CCD for direct, optical imaging.  The beam splitter     
    transmits the near-infrared light (1 to 5 microns) to a 2-prism           
    spectrometer.  For convenience, we consider these as two separate         
    instruments, HRIV (High Resolution Visible CCD) and HRII (High            
    Resolution IR spectrometer), sharing the telescope since the two focal    
    planes operate in parallel asynchronously. The HRI telescope is a         
    classical Cassegrain design with the following parameters:                
                                                                              
    The HRI telescope is a classical Cassegrain design with the following     
    parameters:                                                               
                                                                              
      Primary aperture        : 30.0 cm diameter, round                       
      Primary focal ratio     :  4.5                                          
      Secondary Obscuration   :  9.7 cm diameter, round                       
      Secondary magnification :  7.8x (net Cassegrain focal length 10.5 m)    
      Back focal distance     : 30.0 cm                                       
                                                                              
    The dichroic beam-splitter has equal transmission and reflection          
    occurring at about 1.05 microns.  The filter wheel contains two clear     
    apertures and seven filters.  Five of the filters are roughly 100         
    nanometers in bandwidth, centered at 450, 550, 650, 750, and 850          
    nanometers.  The shortest-wavelength filter is effectively a              
    short-wavelength pass filter starting at 400 nanometers and limited to    
    about 340 nanometers on the short end by the rapid decline in             
    beamsplitter reflectivity.   The longest wavelength filter is a           
    long-pass filter starting at 900 nanometers that uses the CCD response    
    to define the long-wavelength cutoff at about 960 nanometers.  Filter     
    transmission profiles are illustrated by Hampton, et al. (2005)           
    [HAMPTONETAL2005] and provided in the calibrated science data sets        
    for the Deep Impact and EPOXI missions.                                   
                                                                              
    The detector is a 1024 x 1024 split-frame, frame-transfer CCD with        
    21-micron-square pixels, with each quadrant read out through a            
    separate amplifier.  The electronics allows readout of centered           
    sub-frames in multiples of 2:  64x64, 128x128, and so on, with or         
    without rows of overscan.  Transfer time, to move the two halves of       
    the image from the exposing area to the two shielded areas, is about      
    5.2 milliseconds.  Readout time for a full frame is 1.8 seconds.          
                                                                              
    The HRIV instrument in full-frame 1024 x 1024 mode has the following      
    field-of-view characteristics:                                            
                                                                              
      Pixel Size     :   21 micrometers                                       
      Pixel FOV      :  2.0 microradians or 0.41253 arcseconds                
      Instrument FOV :  2.0 milliradians or 0.118 degrees                     
      Surface Scale  :  1.4 meters/pixel at 700 kilometers                    
                                                                              
    The HRIV instrument includes an internal stimulator lamp for              
    calibrating between the four quadrants of the CCD.  The lamp is not a     
    standard calibrator.  One of its in-flight uses is to improve the         
    photometry from the EPOXI exoplanet transit observations.                 
                                                                              
    The three instruments on the flyby spacecraft, HRIV, HRII (High-          
    Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer) and MRI (Medium-Resolution            
    Visible CCD), are mounted on a separate instrument platform               
    together with the star trackers.  The three instruments are               
    nominally co-aligned as described by Klaasen, et al. (2008)               
    [KLAASENETAL2006].                                                        
                                                                              
    For a detailed discussion of the instrument and how it was used during    
    the Deep Impact mission, see Hampton, et al. (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005]     
    and Klaasen, et al. (2005) [KLAASENETAL2005].  For the EPOXI mission,     
    the HRIV instrument is used for imaging 1) transits of known extrasolar   
    planets, 2) Earth as a remotely-sensed planet, and 3) the encounter       
    with comet 103P/Hartley 2.                                                
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Instrument Calibration                                                      
  ======================                                                      
    The HRIV instrument was originally calibrated by using in-flight data     
    acquired during Deep Impact as well as pre-launch data taken during       
    thermal-vacuum tests (TV2 and TV4) performed in 2002 and 2003.            
    In-flight calibrations continue through the EPOXI mission to monitor      
    performance and to provide additional data for refining the data          
    calibration pipeline.  Instrument calibration as well as the pipeline     
    that is shared by Deep Impact and EPOXI is discussed by Klaasen, et al.   
    (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006].                                                 
                                                                              
    Calibration analysis combining Deep Impact and early EPOXI data           
    determined the two halves of the HRIV CCD - the boundary being the two    
    horizontal central lines 511 and 512 (zero based) - while physically      
    consistent across the boundary, are biased during integration so that     
    the centers of the two halves are apparently 1/6 pixel closer to the      
    center, and the two boundary rows show a decrease in sensitivity of       
    1/6.  Reconstructed image files space all lines evenly, so the true       
    image is erroneously vertically pushed apart by 1/3 pixel at its          
    center in these reconstructions.  When making science measurements        
    from HRIV images, one must therefore be very careful to properly          
    account for the two flaws introduced by the apparently narrow central     
    lines on the CCD - a geometric error that separates the image by an       
    extra 1/3 pixel at the horizontal quadrant boundary, and 2) insertion     
    of extra total radiance into calibrated images due to the flat-field      
    correction, which corrects for an apparent radiance deficit in the two    
    central rows because of the smaller number of photons actually            
    incident on those rows.                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Flight Performance                                                          
  ==================                                                          
    The HRIV instrument generally performed as expected during flight.        
    However, images of stars acquired early in the Deep Impact mission        
    indicated the HRI telescope was out of focus.  An analysis showed the     
    focus was forward of the CCD, so bakeouts were performed in late          
    February and early March 2005 to improve the focus.  The bakeouts         
    reduced the defocus from 1.0 cm to 0.6 cm, which caused the width of      
    star images to decrease from about 12 pixels to about 9 pixels.  Star     
    images continued to have a three-fold symmetry (six points) resulting     
    from the three-point mounting of the primary and secondary mirrors.       
    Most of the expected resolution can be regained by applying algorithms    
    to deconvolve the HRIV images as described by Lindler, et al. (2007)      
    [LINDLERETAL2007].  The EPOXI mission takes advantage of the poor         
    focus characteristic which increases the point spread function of         
    measurements, enabling high-precision photometry of known extrasolar      
    planetary systems.  For a detailed discussion about the focus of the      
    HRI telescope, see Klaasen, et al. (2008) [KLAASENETAL2006] and           
    Lindler, et al. (2007) [LINDLERETAL2007].                                 
                                                                              
    Calibration data acquired in 2008 for EPOXI show a 6% increase in the     
    response of the HRIV 950-nm filter (#5) and changes to the electronic     
    crosstalk between the CCD quadrants since 2005.  Therefore new            
    calibration constants for the 950-nm filter and new crosstalk             
    coefficients were calculated and incorporated into the calibration        
    pipeline for EPOXI processing.
