In order to compose the descriptions of what the instruments are measuring
in the "On-Board Instruments Table", I have been looking at the webpage for
the Cassini instruments.
The page location that lists all the instruments for the orbiter with 
links to a description page is
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/Science/orbiter.html
The page location that lists all the instruments for the Huygens Probe
with links to a description page is
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/Science/probe.html
There is also a NSSDC Cassini instrument page. Its URL is
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/database/www-nmc?97-061A-__
There is a NSSDC Huygens Probe instrument page. Its URL is
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/database/www-nmc?HUYGENS-__

To write the mission description of the Cassini mission I have been looking
at the Cassini web site. The site location is 
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cassini/
NSSDC also has Cassini page. The URL is
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/database/www-nmc?97-061A
NSSDC has a Huygens Probe page. The URL is
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/huygens.html
