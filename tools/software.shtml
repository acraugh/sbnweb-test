<h1>SBN Tools, Utilities, and Interfaces</h1>
<p>This page lists tools, suites of utilities, and interfaces developed at the SBN for internal use and for our users to find, read and process the data archived within SBN. These files are updated as routines are updated.
<br /><br />We also make available links to other non-SBN utilities which may be useful when accessing and manipulating data files.
<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> This software is offered <em>as is</em> without guarantees of suitability for use or fool-proofedness. Please practice safe processing!
<br /><br />Programs may require slight modification to run under your own environment. In Perl routines, for example, you will likely have to change the location of the Perl interpreter invoked in the first line of the source file. In IDL, make sure your paths are set correctly so that the main program can find sub-routines.</p>

<h3>FINDING DATA</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CATCH</strong>: a graphical user interface service for searching SBN, and other survey, archives for small bodies. CATCH also has an API interface to facilitate automated searches by object name.
<br /><a href="https://catch.astro.umd.edu/">CATCH: Details and Use</a><br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Data Ferret</strong>: search interface for the small bodies data. It is currently under development.
<br /><a href="https://sbnapps.psi.edu/ferret/">Data Ferret: Details and Use</a><br /><br /></li>
<!-- <li><strong>Small Bodies Cross-ID</strong>: Search for and list all known cross-identifications (including deprecated IDs) for small solar system bodies: comets, asteroids, moons, etc. Users may include wildcards in the input string and filter objects by type.
<br /><a href="form_sbxid.shtml">Details and Use</a><br /><br /></li> -->
<li><strong>Comet Cross-ID</strong>: List comet identifications matching, in whole or in part, an input string.
<br /><a href="form_cxid.shtml">Details and Use</a><br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h3>READING/PREPARING DATA</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>ReadPDS</strong>: Updated for PDS4 and includes IDL and Python versions! Set of IDL procedures designed to read SBN data files, using the information contained in the PDS labels as a guide to accessing the information.
<br /><a href="tools_readPDS.shtml">Details and download</a><br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>PDS4 Viewer</strong>: A tool designed to visualize PDS data, using the information contained in the PDS4 labels as a guide to accessing the information. (PDS4 only.)
<br /><a href="https://sbnwiki.astro.umd.edu/wiki/PDS4_Viewer">Details and download</a><br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>File and Label Formatting/Verifying Routines</strong>: A number of small routines for formatting and/or verifying files and labels.
<br /><a href="tools_file-label.shtml">Details and download</a><br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>On-Line Archiving Facility (OLAF)</strong>: Online tool that allows individuals to submit data to the PDS so that it can be archived and made available to the public.
<br /><a href="https://olaf.psi.edu/">Details and Use</a><br /><br /></li>
<!-- <li><strong>FITS Normalizer</strong>: Tool that helps astronomers prepare their FITS files for submission to NASA's Planetary Data System (PDS) through the Online Archiving Facility (OLAF). 
<br /><a href="http://sbntools.psi.edu/fits/">Details and download</a><br /><br /></li> -->
</ul>

<h3>MODELING DATA</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="/tools/ma-evap/index.shtml" onclick="this.target='_blank'">Sublimation of Ices</a></strong>: M. A'Hearn; This application calculates vaporization for flat surfaces, isothermal spheres and rapid rotators based on observable
parameters entered by the user. Parameters include visual bond albedo, thermal albedo, heliocentric distance and obliquity.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/wvm/" onclick="this.target='_blank'">Web Vectorial Model</a></strong>: M. Festou and J. Parker; This application models cometary activity based on observable parameters entered by the user. The
present version of this tool assumes an isotropically symmetric coma and a steady output from the nucleus.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://sbn.psi.edu/pds/SAM-I/">Statistical Asteroid Model</a></strong>: Tedesco et al. is a database of orbital elements, absolute magnitudes, albedos, and diameters, designed to simulate the population of main belt asteroids
with diameters larger than 1 km. This model is provided through the PDS Small Bodies Node as a service to users. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-SBN Utilities</h3>
<p>Here are other software packages that may be of use when trying to find, access and manipulate data files (images, spectra and tables). Some of the software packages require PDS labels (attached or detached) and some require a FITS file with an
attached FITS header. A detached PDS label will not cause a problem as long as a FITS header exists as part of the data file. Likewise, an attached FITS header will not cause a problem as long as there is an associated detached PDS label.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/datasearch/data-search/" onclick="this.target='_blank'">PDS Data Search</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_viewer.html" onclick="this.target='_blank'">FITS Viewers</a>: various software packages to display or manipulate the relatively simple class of FITS data files that contain 2-dimensional images
<br />Two that have been around for awhile are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ds9.si.edu/" onclick="this.target='_blank'">SAOImage ds9</a>: ds9 allows the user to manipulate FITS data. It requires an attached FITS header. </li>
<li><a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/fv/fv_download.html" onclick="this.target='_blank'">fv</a>: fv is an easy to use graphical program for viewing and editing any FITS format image or table. Fv is capable of reading multiple
FITS extensions. Fv requires an attached FITS header. The Fv software is small, completely self-contained and ready to run on many platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/tools/about/pds3-tools/nasa-view.shtml" onclick="this.target='_blank'">PDS NASAView</a>: NASAView was written to allow the user to display and examine typical PDS archive products containing an image or a table,
.fit and .img files are examples. Each archive file must have an attached or a detached PDS label. The program is not intended to be used for saving and intensive scientific analysis of the data.</li>
<li><a href="https://pds.nasa.gov/tools/tool-registry/" onclick="this.target='_blank'">PDS Tools Registry</a>: several additional using and manipulating data as well as preparing data to archive.</li>
<li><a href="http://sbmt.jhuapl.edu/" onclick="this.target='_blank'">Small Body Mapping Tool</a>: The SBMT is an interactive tool that allows users to visualize and manipulate small body shape models in three dimensions. The Tool enables quick
and easy searches for spacecraft data of a variety of small bodies. Once selected, data can be projected directly onto the shape models, and built-in analysis and mapping capabilities facilitate scientific investigations.</li>
</ul>
