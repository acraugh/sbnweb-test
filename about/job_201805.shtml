<h1>Programmer (2018)</h1>

<p>The Small Bodies Node (SBN) of NASA's Planetary Data System, based in the Department of Astronomy at the University of Maryland, College Park, is seeking a <strong>programmer with front-end or application development experience</strong> who would work with a larger group of planetary scientists and programmers. The Department of Astronomy includes a large number of planetary scientists working primarily on small bodies (comets and asteroids) and on dynamics, and with participants in a variety of missions including Rosetta and Lucy as well as many research projects (see http://www.astro.umd.edu/rareas/). The position is in support of the SBN archiving and oversite efforts.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements include an S.B. or B.A level degree in computer science or a related field, proficiency in C or Python coding, familiarity with UNIX, HTML, CSS, Java and API interfaces. Experience with GUI development and/or database interfaces are also desired, as is some IT administrative experience. The ideal candidate will also work closely with programmers at the Minor Planet Center at the Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA. A Master's level degree is preferred, but previous work experience will also be considered. Near-term tasks include developing a cross-identification database for all bodies represented in the archive, web tool or application development, and occasionally reporting to NASA. Some travel may be involved.</p>
<p>Interested applicants should send a cover letter, a complete resume, and a list of references to SBNjob18@astro.umd.edu. Applications received by June 30, 2018 will receive full consideration. Salary is commensurate with experience.</p>
