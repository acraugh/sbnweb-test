<h1>Images of Comet Hale-Bopp</h1>

<p>This material is all copyright 1997 by Michael F. A'Hearn. It may be freely reproduced for non-commercial purposes with appropriate credit.</p>

<hr />
<p>The pre-perihelion images here were taken on Kodak Ektachrome Professional Film, EHP1600, and push processed by 2 stops as recommended for this film to achieve ASA 1600. All images were taken with a 50-mm lens at f/2.0 from various locations on Mars Hill (the campus of Lowell Observatory) in Flagstaff Arizona. They were all taken at approximately 1997 March 8.5 UT. Because they were all taken from a stationary tripod, there is noticeable trailing of both the comet and the stars in the field.</p>

<a href="img06ss.jpg"><img src="img06thm.jpg" class="left"></a> This image is a 90-second exposure near the beginning of nautical twilight. The blue ion tail, extending into the trees on the left, is well separated from the white dust tail. (23k JPEG)<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a href="img17ss.jpg"><img src="img17thm.jpg" class="left"></a> This image is a 30-second exposure early in astronomical twilight. Both tails are clearly visible. A faint hint of red near the top of the image is the North America Nebula. (29k JPEG)<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a href="img18ss.jpg"><img src="img18thm.jpg" class="left"></a> This image is a 90-second exposure taken immediately after the image above. The reddish area near the top of the image is the North America Nebula. (39k JPEG)<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a href="img24ss.jpg"><img src="img24thm.jpg" class="left"></a> This image was taken well into twilight and is a 30-second exposure that has been darkened in the computer. (25k JPEG)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a href="img25ss.jpg"><img src="img25thm.jpg" class="left"></a> This image is a 90-second exposure taken immediately after the preceding image and artificially darkened in the computer. (29k JPEG)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>These post-perihelion images were taken from Anderson Mesa, the site of Lowell Observatory's principal telescopes near Flagstaff Arizona, on April 28.15 UT. They were taken with a 50-mm lens at f/2.0 on Kodak Ektachrome EHP1600 professional film. They were push processed 3 stops to yield an effective ASA rating of 3200.</p>
<p>
<a href="L0428_30.jpg"><img src="L0428t30.jpg" class="left"></a> This image is a 20-second exposure. (177k JPEG)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a href="L0428_36.jpg"><img src="L0428t36.jpg" class="left"></a> This image is a 40-second exposure. (226k JPEG)<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
