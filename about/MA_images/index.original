The preperihelion images here were taken on Kodak Ektachrome Professional
Film, EHP1600, and push processed by 2 stops as recommended for this
film to achieve ASA 1600.  All images were taken with a 50-mm lens at 
f/2.0 from various locations on Mars Hill (the campus of Lowell Observatory)
in Flagstaff Arizona.  They were all taken at approximately 1997 March 8.5 UT.
Because they were all taken from a stationary tripod, there is noticeable
trailing of both the comet and the stars in the field.

a 30-second exposure early in astronomical twilight.  Both  tails are
clearly visible.  A faint hint of red near the top of the image is the
North America Nebula.  (29k JPEG)

These postperihelion images were taken from Anderson Mesa, the site 
of Lowell Observatory's principal telescopes near Flagstaff Arizona, 
on April 28.15 UT.  They were taken with a 50-mm lens at
f/2.0 on Kodak Ektachrome EHP1600 professional film.  They were
push processed 3 stops to yield an effective ASA rating of 3200.
