<h2>Color Figures</h2>
<hr>

Publication of color figures is substantially more expensive than
publication of black and white. The LOC has not yet determined
whether or not it will be financially possible to print figures
in color, although this decision is expected by the beginnning
of March.
<p>

If it is decided to print color figures, these figures will all be
located in a separate set of pages at the end of the volume and
the editors and referees will examine each request for a color
figure to decide whether or not the use of color justifies the
substantial cost. Authors wishing to use color figures must
explicitly note this fact in submitting their manuscript. They
should also plan the layout of their manuscripts such that, if
color is allowed for a particular figure, it is expected at the
end of the volume, while if it is not allowed, a suitable black
and white figure is also available.
