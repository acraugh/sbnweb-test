<h2>LaTeX Templates</h2>

The formatting of the manuscripts is to be done using the LaTeX
templates provided by Kluwer Academic Press. The templates are
available at 
<a href="http://kapis.www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnlstyle.htm?0167-9295">
Kluwer's Web Site</a>.
<p>

Because there are several different versions of LaTeX in common use,
there may be some problems using the style files. The style files
were all designed to be used in LaTeX2.09, but many institutions are
now using LaTeX2e, which is not well standardized. If you are running
LaTeX2e, you will probably not be able to run LaTeX on the file
kapins.tex in order to produce a nicely formatted set of insructions.
You are likely to get an error message that the command \verb is not
recognized. If this is the case, you can insert the following
code in the preamble to kapins.tex in order to fix the problem:
<p>
<pre>
\makeatletter
\def\verb{\bgroup \catcode``=13 \@noligs
\verbfont \let\do\@makeother \dospecials
\@ifstar{\@sverb}{\@verb}}
\makeatother
(insert before the command \begin{opening})
</pre>
<p>
It is also the case that LaTeX2.09 required separate style files for
including figures into documents. These additional style files are
on the same web page at Kluwer as are the basic files (see link above).
However, some (most?, all?) versions of LaTeX2e have these features
built into the basic compiler. You will not need the special style
files but instead you can insert epsfig or psfig into the argument
of the documentstyle command and omit the \include command as follows;
<p>
<pre>
\documentstyle[epsfig, namedreferences]{kluwer}
%\include{psfig} (i.e. do not use the include command)
%and then for the figure environment (for example):
\begin{figure}
 \epsfig{file=filename.eps, width=12cm}
 \caption{My caption.}
\end{figure}
</pre>
<p>

In the instructions for submission which you will get by running
LaTeX on the file kapins.tex, you will find some instances in which
you are told to choose a format according to the style of the journal
to which the paper is being submitted. The default style for Earth,
Moon, and Planets includes the following choices within kapins.tex:
<ul>
 <li>TITLE SHOULD BE IN ALL CAPS.
 <li>An address for correspondence environment, {ao}, which includes
 your email address as well as your mailing address,
 <li>An abbreviations command only if you use abbreviations in the text
 that are not otherwise defined,
 <li>A \keywords{} command which lists a FEW keywords, such as
 \keyword{comets, chemistry, nucleus},
</ul>
<p>

Here are a couple of other points regarding the style that should
be kept in mind when preparing your LaTeX file.
<ul>
 <li>Chemical formulae used in the text should be in Roman font, not
 in italic font. If you are using equation mode to insert subscripts,
 this means that you should, e.g., use "CO$_2$" 
 instead of "$CO_2$".
 <li>References, whether created manually or with BiBTeX, which
 have comma-separated fields, are sorted alphabetically, and
 include titles of journal articles and ending page numbers.
 (Past practice in the journal has varied but we hope to establish
 a common style for these special issues.)
 <li>Units, when used in the text, are normally set with superscripts for
 negative powers (rather than using the "/" notation) and are also
 in Roman font, e.g., use "km s$^{-1}$" rather
 than "$km s^-1$" or $kms^-1$".
</ul>
<p>
If there are any questions about the style, authors should examine
a recent issue of Earth, Moon, and Planets for examples. References
to other papers presented at the conference and to be included in
the procedings should be referenced as Earth, Moon and Planets in 1998
but with the volume and page numbers marked 'TBD'.
