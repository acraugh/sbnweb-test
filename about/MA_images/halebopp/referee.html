<h2>Guidelines for Referees</h2>
<hr>

Papers for the procedings of the First International Meeting on
Comet Hale-Bopp will be published in several successive issues
of Earth, Moon, and Planets. The papers should be refereed, 
therefore, as though they are normal journal articles with the
appropriately high standards. The fact that the paper was presented 
at the conference does not mean that it should automatically be 
included in the special issue(s).
<p>

There are three types of papers being published.
The invited reviews will be published as one double issue of EMP and also
published as a hard-bound book. These papers are limited to 20
pages each. Contributed papers will appear as subsequent issues
of EMP and are limited to six pages each. In addition to these
papers, which must be held to normal journal standards, we are also 
publishing brief progress reports, nominally limited to one page, 
for those works that are not complete and have not yet reached 
scientifically useful conclusions. Please note that in many cases 
it may be appropriate to recommend that a contributed paper be 
converted to a progress report, particularly in cases where there 
are not yet any conclusions from the work, only presentation of some 
data. In some cases, referees will receive papers that are longer 
than the guidelines (20-6-1 for invited-contributed-progress). While 
the page limit is not a hard one, any length in excess of the 
guidelines must be clearly justified and the referees are asked to 
address this point explicitly if the paper exceeds the guideline
for length.
<p>

Papers will be sent to referees, both for initial refereeing and for
second refereeing when the referee has suggested major revisions,
by the most expeditious means possible, depending on the format in 
which we received the paper from the author. This format is likely 
to be electronic, either LaTeX or PostScript, but we may send it as 
several messages, one for the text and one for each of the figures. 
Because of the vagaries of LaTeX, the figures may or may not be 
automatically incorporated into the printed paper when you run LaTeX. 
<p>

<h3>Sample Referee's Form</h3>
A sample refereeing form is <a href="./ref.tpl">available here</a> which
you can download and submit to us by email. It is not necessary to use
this form, although we would appreciate it if you would address all the
points mentioned on the form. In some cases, referees will receive
papers that are longer than the guidelines (20-6-1 for 
invited-contributed-progress). While the page limit is not a hard
one, any length in excess of the guidelines must be clearly justified
and the referees are asked to address this point explicitly.
<p>
<hr>
We are particularly grateful to the many people who have been willing
to take on the task of refereeing several papers from the conference.
We understand the burden but peer review is still the best mechanism
available to ensure scientific quality.
