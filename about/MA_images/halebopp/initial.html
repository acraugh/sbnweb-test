<h2>Initial Submission of Manuscript</h2>
<hr>
When submitting a manuscript to be refereed, which at this point should
be only late papers and the invited reviews, it is sufficient to submit
a postscript file containing the formatted text. It is useful to also
send a printed copy of the manuscript so that we can check that our
formatted output matches yours, but this is not essential unless we
have a problem printing your postscript file. If that happens, we will
contact you directly to tell you that there is a problem and that we
will instead need two complete printed copies of your manuscript.
<p>

Your postscript file can be submitted either by electronic mail or by
anonymous ftp to our site here at Maryland. Please see the more
detailed instructions regarding electronic submission on the page 
for <a href="./final.html">Final Submission</a>. Before committing 
to using color for your figures, please read the comments on 
<a href="./color.html">Color Figures</a>.
