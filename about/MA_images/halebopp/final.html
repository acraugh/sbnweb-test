<h2>Submitting Final Manuscripts</h2>
<hr>

<h3>What to Submit</h3>

In order to expedite publication of the procedings, final manuscripts
should be submitted in two forms. The first form should be a single
PostScript file containing everything properly formatted except for
color figures, if any (see separate instructions regarding color
figures). The second form should be a LaTeX file, using the Kluwer
style files as previously indicated on the web pages for this meeting,
together with all figures, e.g. in encapsulated postscript. A paper
copy is also desirable, just in case we have trouble printing your
files, but this is not essential unless we contact you and tell you
that we have had a problem with your electronic submission.
<p>

In addition to the revised manuscript, you should also submit a cover
letter by email indicating your response to each of the referee's
comments. A copy of this cover letter should also be sent to the
co-editors, hboehnha@eso.org, mrk@iac.es, and rwest@eso.org.

<h3>Compression and Encoding</h3>

Please try to avoid the encoding of files imposed by some "mime-aware"
mailing systems. These systems are common on PCs and Macintoshes.
While I can sometimes decode these attachments here on a Unix system,
it requires that I actually switch to a different windowing system and
even then it is not always possible.
<p>

We can deal easily with three forms of encoded/compressed files. These
compression schemes are 'compress' (the Unix utility), 'gzip' 
(available both on Unix-based systems and on many PC/Macintosh
systems), and uuencode (another Unix utility). Please do not use
any other forms of compression when transmitting your files.
Note also that uuencode is purely an encoding scheme which uses
ASCII characters to represent true binary files, it is not
a compression scheme. It therefore sometimes enhances transferability
but it sometimes also actually expands the size of the file.
On Unix systems you can also use the tar utility to wrap a bunch
of files into a single, compressed unit. If you use tar, you
may either tar several individual files together into a single
tar file or you may tar an entire directory containing the files
into a single tar file.
<p>

<h3>Email Submission</h3>

Small files can be submitted by electronic mail. Both PostScript and
LaTeX files are easily transmitted through most email systems, as long
as they are not too large. The size limit varies considerably from one
system to another, but anything under 100 kbytes is probably acceptable
everywhere and anything over about 3 MBytes is probably unacceptable
everywhere. HOWEVER! compressed files are often not correctly transmitted
through email systems. If you choose email submission, email your files 
to Mike A'Hearn, ma@astro.umd.edu. Please use a separate email message for
each separate file (.tex, .eps, .ps, etc.) and indicate in the subject
line what each message contains. Please do not transmit anything
over 0.5 MBytes by email since it may choke our system and since several
of them in succession could overfill the mail queue causing everyone in
the department to lose email.
<p>

<h3>Anonymous ftp Submission</h3>

Files of any size can be submitted by anonymous ftp. In this case,
it is possible on Unix systems to wrap up all your files in a single
'tar' file which is then transferred by ftp in BINARY mode. This
tar file can also be compressed. Note that plain LaTeX and 
PostScript files can usually be transferred in ASCII mode, although
compressed files are likely to require BINARY mode.
<p>

<pre>
ftp ftp.astro.umd.edu
user: anonymous
ID: you@emailaddress (use your entire email address because our system compares the email domain with the domain from which you are logged in)
cd incoming
binary (use only if needed because you are using a tar or compressed file)
put filename (repeat as needed)
quit
</pre>
<p>
Note that if you make a mistake transferring the file (e.g. using ASCII
when you should have used BINARY), our system will not let you overwrite 
the old file. You will have to retransmit the file using a new name.
After you have transferred the file(s), be sure to send an email message
to Mike A'Hearn, ma@astro.umd.edu, telling him the name(s) of the file(s)
you have transferred.
